# Deadspace Beacon

This code was written for the ESP8266, using PlatformIO with the Arduino Framework. 

The purpose of this code is to enable the ESP8266 to act as an adhoc network for devices to connect to, so that they can talk to eachother on that network but have no internet or network access except to other devices which are also  attached to that same network.

In short... 

This causes the ESP8266 to act as a kind of wireless networking switch. 

## Why it was created...
I created this because I have devices I need to wirelessly put on the same network but I don't want them on my home network or anywhere that has Internet access. Sure there are already devices out there like an AP that can do this already BUT I don't have any of those sitting around unused right now and I needed something now. I do have lots of these ESP8266 chips sitting around though so here we are.

In the future, I would like to make them more versital and useful for a wider range of applicaitons, so I will plan to circle back to this project when I have time. Right now they work for my current use-case and I am putting my code up here to back it up.
